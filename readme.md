in my quest to make this survey form i made use of....
Html
css
just one lineof code in my javascript

i made use of: url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:200i,400&display=swap');

the image for the background was gotten from: url(https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/images/survey-form-background.jpeg);

i made use of media queries for the responsiveness.
